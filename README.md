# hello-world.
I am beginning on a journey.

I dream of living in a world where I can embark on a journey with my friends, for a goal very dear to me.
Through this journey there are many emotional spikes and such, but ultimatley everything turns out okay.
The journey is long but extremely enjoyable with my friends, and friends who I make along the way.
In this world, super powers are a thing. Difference in power levels exist, and skill is required.
Hard work and dedication, love and sacrifice. Compassion and kindness.
